We develop a method to solve the electromagnetic inverse design problem; that is, to find a dielectric structure that will produce a specified electromagnetic field. Such a method enables the design of non-intuitive, multi-objective photonic components such as small mode-volume or doubly-resonant cavities, broadband waveguide couplers and dispersion-tailored waveguides.

\section*{Problem Challenge}
The electromagnetic inverse design problem is challenging because
\begin{itemize}
\item realistic dielectric structures are typically binary, consisting of only two discrete dielectric materials, and
\item there is no one-to-one correspondence between field profiles and dielectric structures, since certain field profiles are impossible to achieve.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section*{Current Progress}
Currently, we have been able to produce two-dimensional proof-of-concept designs including
\begin{itemize}
\item line and ``X'' resonators,
\item degenerate and non-degenerate doubly-resonant cavities, and
\item a single to dual-beam waveguide coupler.
\end{itemize}
