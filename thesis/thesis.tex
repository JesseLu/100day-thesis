% basically this is a template file, you should be able to take it and
% start running.

% the philosophy behind this template is that each chapter or
% chapterlike section goes in a separate file and you use the \include
% command to input it into the final document.  The \includeonly
% command can be used so you only need to work on one or two chapters at a
% time (instead of having to either latex the entire book each time or
% losing cross-references and page numbering)

% copy this file and call it something like mythesis.tex

\documentclass[12pt]{report}
% note that the documentclass can take other option such as
% twoside - for double sided printing
% openright - if double side  chapters always start on odd pages
% openany - if double side chapters start on the next page even or odd
% 12pt can be replaced by 11pt

\usepackage{suthesis-2e}

%% load other packages you need
\input defs
\usepackage{suthesis-2e,graphicx,subfigure,setspace, topcapt,amssymb,amsmath}
%\usepackage{site} %did not work with hyperref
\usepackage{natbib} %works with hyperref
\usepackage[pdftex,bookmarks=true, colorlinks=true,linkcolor=blue,

%% uncomment the following and create mythesis-macros.sty for all your
%% own macros.  This keeps this top level file looking fairly neat.
% \usepackage{mythesis-macros}

%% certain types of theses require special title page format.  See the
%% style file for the full list.  An example would be that for some of
%% the language departments. 
% \dualthesis \dept{Asian Languages} \languagemajor{Korean} 
%% or education
% \educationthesis

    \title{Nanophotonic Computational Design}
    \author{Jesse Ying-Shou Lu}
    \dept{Electrical Engineering}
    \principaladviser{Jelena Vuckovic}
% \coprincipaladvisor{}
    \firstreader{David Miller}
    \secondreader{Shanhui Fan}
% \thirdreader{}

%the following command would (if uncommented) allow  only chapter1 and
%chapter2 to be processed
%\includeonly{chapter1,chapter2}

% if you feel real savvy use
% \typein{Now put in includeonly}
% the \typein command stops latex at this point and allows you to type
% in a command such as
% \includeonly{chapter3,chapter5}
% this can save some time and means you don't have to edit this file
% as much.
